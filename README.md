## Description
This project uses a Teachable Machine image model to classify between two classes: cups and spoons.

## Files Included
- keras_model.h5 – The trained model file
- labels.txt – Label file with class names
- test.jpg – Test image used to predict
- predict.py – Python script to load the model and predict the class
- result.png – Screenshot of the output prediction

## How to Use
1. Place all files in the same folder.
2. Run the script using:
