# AI Task – Image Classification using Teachable Machine

This project uses a Teachable Machine image model to classify images into two categories: cups and spoons.

## 📝 Description
A pre-trained model built with Teachable Machine is used to identify whether an input image shows a cup or a spoon.

## 📂 Files Included
- keras_model.h5 – Trained image classification model  
- labels.txt – Class labels (cup, spoon)  
- test.jpg – Sample image for testing  
- predict.py – Python script for running predictions  
- result.png – Screenshot of the prediction output

## ⚙️ How to Use
1. Make sure all files are in the same directory.  
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python predict.py

## 🖥️ Output
The output will look like this:
